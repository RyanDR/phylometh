Index,Title,Description
0,Getting ready,"What is required to start class: installing R, installing the phylogenetics task view, getting a github account. All free. But watch the next video first if you want to evaluate whether to take the class."
1,Why bother with trees?,"Trees: what are they good for? Actually a lot, from understanding host-parasite coevolution to looking at how flowers have evolved to examining correlations between traits to looking at why there are so many beetles."
2,Great scientists steal (trees),"People have been making trees for a long time. Find out how to reuse them for your research (and yes this is valid reuse, not stealing)."
3,Getting sequence data,"If you are building a tree for your group, it often makes sense to first see what sequence data are available, so you can know what, if anything, needs to be added."
4,Taxonomic name resolution,"Taxonomy has rules regarding the creation and merging of names (I couldn't rename our species as Homo phylogensis), but confusingly it can allow multiple names to exist at the same time (if someone has split a genus into two genera, for example). Thus, the same species can have different names in different studies, and from taxonomy's view, that's completely ok. There are tools to help get around this practical problem."
5,Mind the gap (in your alignment),Why is alignment of sequences an issue? What are some possible solutions?
6,Parsimony for tree inference,What is parsimony? How can it be used?
7,Long branch attraction,More data leading to answers that more likely to be wrong?!
8,Bayes vs Likelihood,"There are two main approaches to inferring trees: using likelihood, or using likelihood plus priors to get posteriors. What do these mean?"
9,Multimodel comparison,Akaike and friends
10,Discrete state models in general,"""Discrete state continuous time Markov chains"": basically, the models we use for things ranging from DNA to amino acids to whether or not something lays eggs. You'll understand the jargon, but more importantly, what these models do."
11,Tree inference using RAxML,Fast way to return phylogenies
12,Tree inference using RevBayes,Bayesian tree inference and dating
13,Tree inference using BEAST,Bayesian tree inference and dating
14,Tree inference using *BEAST,"If the gene trees don't agree, this approach may set the truth free"
15,Dating,Getting a tree with ages
16,Brownian motion,"Add a bunch of random stuff together over evolutionary time, and get something that can be described by an equation with just two parameters, and which is widely useful in evolutionary biology as a model."
17,The attraction of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models,"Models that are similar to Brownian motion, but involve a pull towards a value."
18,Independent contrasts,Control for phylogeny
19,Heterogeneity,Blue whales and bats probably evolve a bit differently (everything from their DNA to body size). How can we deal with this
20,Diversification models,Ones that don't model trait evolution
21,SSE models,Traits plus diversification
22,Simulating data,The utility and procedure of just making things up
23,Building a new comparative method,"If you have a question, but can't solve it using current methods, fix this."
24,Testing a new comparative method,Testing a new method is important before unleashing it on the world. And testing involves more than just seeing the results look ok from one or more empirical datasets.
