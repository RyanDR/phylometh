Index,Title,Description,Keywords0,Getting ready,"What is required to start class: installing R, installing the phylogenetics task view, getting a github account. All free. But watch the next video first if you want to evaluate whether to take the class.","github,R,rstats,task view"1,Why bother with trees?,"Trees: what are they good for? Actually a lot, from understanding host-parasite coevolution to looking at how flowers have evolved to examining correlations between traits to looking at why there are so many beetles.","inspiration, evolution, ecology, use cases"2,Great scientists steal (trees),"People have been making trees for a long time. Find out how to reuse them for your research (and yes this is valid reuse, not stealing).","TreeBase, Open Tree of Life, Dryad, Phylotastic, Phylomatic, reuse, open science"3,Getting sequence data,"If you are building a tree for your group, it often makes sense to first see what sequence data are available, so you can know what, if anything, needs to be added.","GenBank, NCBI, ape, phlawd, Mesquite, phylota, reuse, open science"4,Taxonomic name resolution,"One of taxonomy's main goals is to organize life. It has failed. For example, the brown anole's valid name is Anolis sagrei. Its valid name is also Norops sagrei. Which you use is not a biological question (it's not like splitting a species, where one might, say, measure interbreeding, find there are two species, and split) but rather a matter of taste, and both are allowed. There are various approaches to try to deal with this when combining data from different sources with different opinions.","taxonomic name resolution, TNRS, Open Tree of Life, Encyclopedia of Life, Global Names Index"5,Mind the gap (in your alignment),Why is alignment of sequences an issue? What are some possible solutions?,"alignment, muscle, mafft, SAT_, PASTA, POY, clustal"6,Parsimony for tree inference,What is parsimony? How can it be used?,"parsimony, PAUP, phangorn"7,Long branch attraction,More data leading to answers that more likely to be wrong?!,"parsimony, distance, long branch attraction, Felsenstein zone, fly trap, Farris zone"8,Bayes vs Likelihood,"There are two main approaches to inferring trees: using likelihood, or using likelihood plus priors to get posteriors. What do these mean?","DNA, AA, models, discrete trait continuous time, Markov process, GTR, HKY, JC, Pagel 1994"9,Multimodel comparison,,"Brownian motion, comparative methods, ancestral state reconstruction, contrasts, rates, continuous trait"10,Discrete state models in general,"""Discrete state continuous time Markov chains"": basically, the models we use for things ranging from DNA to amino acids to whether or not something lays eggs. You'll understand the jargon, but more importantly, what these models do.","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, continuous trait, attraction"11,Tree inference using RAxML,Fast way to return phylogenies,"gamma, rate heterogeneity, tree slicing, tree stretching, covarion, HMM"12,Tree inference using RevBayes,Bayesian tree inference and dating,"Bayesian, likelihood, frequentist, models, statistics, priors, posteriors"13,Tree inference using BEAST,Bayesian tree inference and dating,"RAxML, likelihood, tree inference"14,Tree inference using *BEAST,"If the gene trees don't agree, this approach may set the truth free","RevBayes, Bayesian, tree inference"15,Dating,Getting a tree with ages,"BEAST, Bayesian, tree inference"16,Brownian motion,"Add a bunch of random stuff together over evolutionary time, and get something that can be described by an equation with just two parameters, and which is widely useful in evolutionary biology as a model.","*BEAST, Bayesian, gene tree species tree"17,The attraction of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models,"Models that are similar to Brownian motion, but involve a pull towards a value.",18,Independent contrasts,Control for phylogeny,"chronogram, dating, r8s, BEAST, pathd8"19,Heterogeneity,Blue whales and bats probably evolve a bit differently (everything from their DNA to body size). How can we deal with this,20,Diversification models,,21,SSE models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Simulating data,The utility and procedure of just making things up,,Building a new comparative method,"If you have a question, but can't solve it using current methods, fix this.",,Testing a new comparative method,Testing a new method is important before unleashing it on the world. And testing involves more than just seeing the results look ok from one or more empirical datasets.,
