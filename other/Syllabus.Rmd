## EEB603: Phylogenetic Methods (PhyloMeth). Spring 2016
Syllabus version: `r format(Sys.time(), '%I:%M %p, %d %B, %Y')`

Instructor: **[Brian O'Meara](http://www.brianomeara.info)** (bomeara@utk.edu)

Course website: **http://phylometh.org**

Office Hours (446 Hesler) by appointment.

####Anonymous feedback
http://www.brianomeara.info/feedback. This is the first time the course is being run, and it's taught in a very different way from most courses. There is a lot that will go wrong. Let me know what's not working while it can still improve.

#### What you will learn
This is a modern class in phylogenetic methods. You will learn how to get data, build a tree, use comparative methods, and how to make new methods. More importantly, you will learn _why_ to do all this.

#### Requirements
* A laptop on which you can install software (have root / admin access)
    + It'll be easiest if this is a Mac; less easy is Linux; Windows will be hard
* A question and some data to answer it
* GitHub account
* Gitter
* R
* And other software we'll learn about during the course

#### Evaluation
Grading will be based on effort. Some of the things will be harder for some students than others just given differences in what they've been exposed to so far, and I don't want to penalize students who are less skilled at R, for example. But I do require that you put in work on this class: work through the exercises, think about the papers, etc. Much of the homework is chewy, so it will take some thought to get through, and you might not be able to do all of this. That's ok.

#### Teaching
The class is flipped: rather than me droning at the front of the room, I'll be releasing videos online for you to watch. They will be linked to from this syllabus. In class, talk about what was not clear from the videos about methods, and we'll dig into that. We can also work on problematic parts of the exercises (you should do most of them before class) and talk about papers.

#### Online option
There is an online option, as well. In this first running of the class, I'm not seeking to give out credit, but online visitors are encouraged to sign up.
