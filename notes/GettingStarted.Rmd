##Objectives
By the end of this week, you will have:

* All required tools installed
* Rudimentary understanding of
    + git
    + unit testing
    + command line
* Ability to do the first assignment
* Ability to talk to classmates
    
Things I want you do are **in bold**.     

In this class we'll be using a variety of programs and technologies. Most are open source: "software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone" https://opensource.org. For science, open source software is important: we build on the work of others in making discoveries, and open software allows others to build on it in the same way. It also aids transparency and reproducibility: you can go deep into code to see what is being done, and even if a developer stops supporting software, someone else can take it over and maintain it.

Every student needs a [GitHub](http://github.com) account so we can all use git together. Git is like a mixture of track changes in Microsoft Word, simultaneous editing in a Google Docs form, and a set of files backed up with Dropbox. It is used a lot by people writing software: you can keep track of who has added changes to code, roll back code to an earlier version, and merge code that was worked on different people at the same time. GitHub is a place where a lot of open source software is housed. It offers free accounts (with some restrictions). We'll be using it to do homework and for our discussions.

**Go to [GitHub](http://github.com) now and get an account.**

Once you have an account, **go to https://gitter.im/bomeara/phylometh**. Gitter is a free service that allows for group chats (think of something like Skype chatting). I have made a public group for the course: anyone can join or read the texts. You can download various apps for Gitter for your laptop or phone: https://gitter.im/apps.

You will need a variety of software: **right now, R and git**; eventually, things like MrBayes, Beast, and more. 

On a Mac, it is easiest to first install MacPorts (will help a lot with later steps): see [here](https://www.macports.org/install.php) for how to do that. Then install git. For Linux, you probably already know how to use a package manager. For Windows, there is a git installer, but you might consider something like cygwin as well.

To **install R**, go to your preferred CRAN mirror to download it: I'd suggest https://cran.rstudio.com. What does all this mean? CRAN = Comprehensive R Archive Network: it's where a lot of R packages are stored and readied for installation. A mirror is a computer that stores a copy of files on another computer. This is an old school approach to creating redundancy and convenience: rather than every R user in the world trying to copy a file off of one computer's hard drive connected to the wall with one ethernet cable, there's a whole set of computers, often with one fairly close to the user and so with faster download speeds. However, these can have their own issues: some might not update their copies often (look at [this](https://cran.r-project.org/mirmon_report.html) to see some of these), some are slow, etc. A more modern approach is a content delivery network (CDN): a distributed set of servers, and a user is automatically routed to the best one for her or him given location, speed, server status, etc. When you watch a movie on Netflix, you're not using the same server as everyone else, for example. The R mirror I suggest you use is one run by the RStudio commercial company: it's actually a CDN and is secure and fast. Unlike the other R mirrors, it also records number of times each package is downloaded, which can be useful data for package authors.
