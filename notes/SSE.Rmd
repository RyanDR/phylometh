##Objectives
By the end of this week, you will:

* Understand models that look at the effects of traits on diversification
* Understand some of the problems with these
* Be able to categorize Type I and Type II errors and talk about their relevance.

Make sure to **read the relevant papers**: https://www.mendeley.com/groups/8111971/phylometh/papers/added/0/tag/sse/    

At this point in the course, you should be familiar with working through getting software running. If you want more practice, you could use the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hisse/vignettes/hisse-vignette.html) written by Jeremy Beaulieu for hisse; running diversitree is similar. However, I think a bigger thing to discuss is how we understand a method is working well, and how we assess whether results are believable. This is especially prominent in discussions of diversification. One great example of this discussion in the literature:

* [Nee et al. (1994)](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/344/1307/77) "Extinction rates can be estimated from molecular phylogenies"
* [Rabosky (2009)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00926.x/abstract) "Extinction rates should not be estimated from molecular phylogenies" 
* [Beaulieu and O'Meara (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12614/abstract) "Extinction rates can be estimated from moderately sized molecular phylogenies"
* [Rabosky (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12820/full) "Challenges in the estimation of extinction from molecular phylogenies: A response to Beaulieu and O'Meara"

And that probably isn't the last word on this (no, I'm not planning something at the moment). However, despite all the hemming and hawing over what people *should* do, people still keep using methods: folks using `diversitree`, `BAMM`, `geiger`, or many other approaches merrily estimate extinction rates as a necessary part of their analyses, though they usually don't focus on them in their studies, instead focusing on diversification (speciation - extinction) or speciation alone. (Note: it is possible to do diversification approaches without estimating extinction rates: one could fix extinction rate at a known value (perhaps using the average duration of fossil "species" to get a fixed estimate), though what is usually done is to fix extinction at 0 (this is called a Yule model, if speciation is constant). This is a bit weird when you think about it: one of the few things we truly know in biology without a doubt is that extinction is far, far from zero in general (though this wasn't [really discovered in Western science until the 19th century](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/artio/irishelk.html))). But as skeptical scientists, we should aim higher. It's often tempting, especially as students or postdocs facing a difficult job market, to focus on what we can get out: is there an exciting result that can get past peer review and build our fame (maybe, in our tiny circle) and fortune (ha!). But it's important to take a step back: are we confident enough, truly (not just based on the p-value) that our results are actually discoveries about nature? Diversification is an area (ancestral state estimation is another) where the reality of results is especially worrisome. Take, for example, [Etienne et al. (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12565/abstract), who as part of a broader simulation study, analyzed a dataset of 25 *Dendroica* warbler species, which is a classic dataset for these studies, fitting a logistic growth model. They found that depending on how the model was conditioned[^1], something most users would ignore, the estimated carrying capacity (in this model, the number of warbler species at which speciation equals extinction; in other models, this would be the number of species at which speciation is zero, with extinction *always* set to zero) for warblers is 24.59 or 6.09 or 0.656. 

[^1]: Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that some other event has occurred. For example, you could use past information from your department to estimate `Prob(getting tenure)`, but it is different if you use information that another event has occurred: `Prob(getting tenure | made major discovery in evolution)` is different from `Prob(getting tenure | four years since last publication)`. In this domain (diversification alone and diversification plus trait models), we condition on actually having a tree to look at: if the true model is speciation rate equals extinction rate, there's a good chance that most clades starting X million years ago will have gone extinct, so the ones we see diversified unusually quickly, and this has to be taken into account. The example I usually use for this is the idea that dolphins rescue drowning sailors. It's known dolphins push interesting objects in the ocean. We could interview previously drowning sailors that dolphins pushed towards shore, and they'll all say that dolphins saved them, but it's very hard to interview sailors the dolphins pushed the other way. As always, Randall Munroe's XKCD explains conditional probability best: ![Seashell XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/seashell.png)
